Just about all bikes are used in the 5-15 minute range, likely reserved for peoples short commutes to work, next to no usage past the 50 minute mark.

The same Viz with gender specific trend lines. Males being the highest consuming group, even if hypothetically all of the 'Unknown' group was female.

A heatmap showcasing bike trip frequency based on the day and hour used. Seems to morph around the 9-5 workforce potentially? A well as just everyday commutes within those same hours

Similar Viz seperated by gender, this seperation shows a particular uptick in male use towards the closing hours of the day, at least relative to the female group

Switched the heatmap to compare regular users to the people with memberships. The most use coming from the male subcriber tier by a long shot.

A simple bar chart displaying the peak hours in the month of August, that being ~5 to ~8pm.

I believe that with Des Moines being the largest city in Iowa while still being relatively centralized, a convenient transportation startup could do quite well, you could always start with a small round of bikes to see if it is recieved well. In a city with bustling streets and packed side walks, the biking lane seems like the best option.

Having a larger dataset that encompassed more of the year could help get an even better idea of whether this venture proves to be a profitable one.

Also including a timeframe where promotional offers were ran relative to normal payment plans could aid in the marketing side of things.
